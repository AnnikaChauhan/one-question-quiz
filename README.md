# One Question Quiz

A repo for the tech test "one question quiz" completed as a practice.

This project was completed using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript very simply testing the basic principle of submitting an answer to a form and this response being checked and validated on the screen. I have built this project so that everything renders from the JS and the question and answer can be changed relatively easily.
